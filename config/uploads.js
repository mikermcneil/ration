  * Sails apps upload and download to the local disk filesystem by default,  *
  * using a built-in filesystem adapter called `skipper-disk`. This feature  *
  * is mainly intended for convenience during development since, in          *
  * production, many apps will opt to use a different approach for storing   *
  * uploaded files, such as Amazon S3, Azure, or GridFS.                     *
  *                                                                          *
